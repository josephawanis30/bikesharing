This heatmap image shows how much of the userbase is dominated by males, subscribing users. More data need to be
looked into to see why male rides were more users than females and others riders.


# Summary:
The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of Aug-2019.  The majority of the rides were in the
Manhattan District, and male users during the morning and evening rush hours.  It shows that the public is using alternative ways of
transportation such as bike sharing.
